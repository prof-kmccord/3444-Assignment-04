# IMMABooks Customer Invoice Management

MMABooks, a leading book distributor, is experiencing a rapid growth in its customer base and sales. With increasing transactions, there is a pressing need to have an efficient system in place for managing customer invoices. The management team identifies the following business challenges:

- Difficulty in quickly viewing and searching for customer details.
- Challenges in tracking individual product sales and their related invoices.
- The absence of a streamlined process to view the breakdown of an invoice, including individual line items and their associated costs.
- To address these challenges, MMABooks requires a Visual Basic Windows Form application that enables users to:

- Search for customer details using customer names.
- View corresponding invoices for each customer.
- Display the breakdown of an invoice to show individual products, quantities, and their total cost.
